Research Question: Identifying the most optimal location for a cafe in Walthamstow

Caf√© Nero is opening a cafe in Walthamstow. This project seeks to identify the most optimal location for the cafe to maximise footfall. 
OSMnx was utilised to obtain a graph of Walthamstow with a 2000m radius. This graph was used to explore closeness centrality, degree centrality, betweenness centrality and land use. 

Figure 1 shows that Walthamstow Central has the greatest closeness centrality, indicating that Walthamstow Central is a highly accessible location. 
This is expected as the London Overground and Underground stations are situated in this location. Similarly, Figure 2 shows that Walthamstow Central has a high degree centrality, suggesting that this node is directly connected to many other nodes.
By contrast, Figure 3 reveals that Walthamstow Central does not have a high betweenness centrality. Figure 3 evidences high betweenness centrality on Hoe Street. This suggests that this node acts as an intermediary in the shortest path between other nodes. 

Therefore, it can be suggested that Caf√© Nero ought to locate a coffee shop around Selborne Road as there is a high closeness centrality and a high degree centrality at this node. 
As this node is highly accessible and can be directly reached by many other nodes, it means that people are more likely to visit the cafe as it is conveniently placed.
As well as this, Selborne Road is adjacent to Hoe Street which means it will have high visibility which is likely to yield greater footfall. Figure 4 confirm this argument as retail shops and train stations are located on Selborne Road.
